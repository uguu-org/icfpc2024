## TL;DR

1. Rewrite the evaluator a few times until it eventually passed the language test (~10 hours).
2. Solve Lambdaman with a greedy strategy (~2.5 hours).
3. Solve Spaceship with a greedy strategy (~0.5 hours).
4. Rewrite the evaluator a few more times for efficiency (~8 hours).
5. Give up and solve efficiency problems by hand (~4 hours).
6. Implement 3D interpretor (~5 hours).
7. Solve 3D problems by hand (~8 hours).
